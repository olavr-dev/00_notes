## What is Javascript?

Programming language that can be executed by browsers.

HTML - Defines structure and semantic.

- Display and manage complex overlays.
- Re-order, hide/show or remove elements on the screen, e.g. drag-and-drop list.

## Core JavaScript Syntax & Features

Syntax is the "grammar" of a programming language. You have to adhere to certain rules.

**JavaScript code is executed top to bottom, left to right.**

### Roadmap

1. Variables & Values
2. Arrays & Objects
3. Functions
4. Working with the "DOM"
5. Control Structures

## Understanding Values

`"Hi, I'm Olav"` this text, also known as a String.

`42` This is a number

`"42"` This is a String (text)

## Understanding Variables

Variables are data containers where you can store values.

`var` Legacy variable. Do not use. Replaced by `let`

`let` This variable can be set and overwritten

`const`

## Best Practices

- Use camelCase when naming variables
- Be descriptive in your variables
- Stick to either double quotes or single quotes. Both are equally fine, but do not use both randomly.
- Semicolons are optional, but it will clearly mark where a line ends. Be consistent. Always use them, or never.
