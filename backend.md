# Backend (server-side) development

Server-side code is written in a language that can be executed on a server.

Since a "server" is in the end just a regular computer, we can use basically any programming language.

Some languages are more suited for this though, and some of the more popular ones for web development are:

`Python` `PHP` `C#` `NodeJS (JavaScript)`

## NodeJS

NodeJS is JavaScript for the server-side. It is a JavaScript Runtime.

It is JavaScript as learned for frontend use, but with more features like read + write files, parse incoming requests, send responses and more.
