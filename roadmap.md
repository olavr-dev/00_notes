# My Web Developer Roadmap

⚡ **_This is how I plan to do my web developer journey_** ⚡

## 🚀 March 5th 2024 - Time to start learning

**Step 1** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[100 Days of Code - 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/)** _by Academind_

**Step 2** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** - Learning more web development without as much hand-holding.

- **JavaScript** track first
- **Ruby** track second

**Step 3** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)** - Basically just using FreeCodeCamp to make additional projects after Odin Project.

**_Complete the FreeCodeCamp's core curriculum certifications:_**

- **[Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) Certification**
- **[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/) Certification**
- **[Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) Certification**
- **[Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/) Certification**
- **[Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) Certification**
- **[Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) Certification**

💡**Time to learn more about Object Oriented Programming + Data Structures and Algorithms**

To get a basic understanding of data structures and algorithms, read the following books while also working on the steps below.

📖 **Read the first half of the book ["Computer Science Distilled"](https://code.energy/computer-science-distilled/#get-your-copy)** _by Wladston Ferreira Filho_

📖 **ead the first half of the book ["Grokking Algorithms"](https://www.ark.no/produkt/boker/fagboker/grokking-algorithms-9781617292231)** _by Aditya Bhargava_

---

**Step 4** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[CS 50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)** Learning the fundamentals of programming languages.

**Step 5** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-deep-dive)** _by Abdul Bari_ to learn OOP with a compiled language.

**Step 6** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/)** _by Abdul Bari_ to learn DSA concepts in-depth.

**_Learning OOP with an interpreted language:_**

**Step 7** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Certification** _by FreeCodeCamp_

**Step 8** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Certification** _by FreeCodeCamp_

**Step 9** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice)** first half 1-75 using Python 🎓 **These are commonly used for interview questions.**

## ♻️ Recap

At this point, I have enough 🛠️ tools in my 🧰 toolbox for most entry level web developer jobs.

- I know two web languages (**JavaScript and Ruby**)
- A compiled OOP language (**C++**)
- An interpreted OOP language (**Python**)
- **SQL databases** (The Odin Project Ruby track)
- **NoSQL databases** (The Odin Project JavaScript track)
