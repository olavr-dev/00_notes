# CSS Transformations & Transitions

## Transformation

Move / change appearance of an element, e.g. when hovering.

`transform: scale (2);`

## Transition

Smooth transition from initial state to transformed state.

`transition: transform 750ms ease-out 500ms` shorthand method

`transform` property

`750ms` duration in milliseconds (or seconds if you prefer)

`ease-out` timing function (starts fast, slows down at the end of the transition duration)

`500ms` delay (how long you need to hover over the element before the transition starts)
