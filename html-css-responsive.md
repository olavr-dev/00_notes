# Responsive Web Design

Use `flexbox` for 2 dimensional layout.

Use `grid` for 3 dimensional layout.

For example: A nav bar works best with `flexbox` and a container filled with content cards that might move based on responsive design or that you need to position individually, it's easier to use `grid`.
