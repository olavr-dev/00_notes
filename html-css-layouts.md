# HTML & CSS Layouts and Positioning

## Page Structure

Header `<header>`

Navigation Bar `<nav>`

Main Content `main` will also contain various `<article>` `<section>` `<div>`

Sidebar `<aside>` often placed inside `main`

Footer `<footer>`

## Flexbox

Use `display: flex` on the parent container

Default mode is `flex-direction: row` so the children will be displayed beside each other.

`flex-direction: column` will display them underneath each other.

`flex-wrap: nowrap` is the default. Change to `flex-wrap: wrap` to make the flex move underneath each other when the screen size gets too small to show them side by side.
